In response to the email regarding the request for table partitioning, here’s a detailed explanation:

Reason for Request: The vendor might be requesting table partitioning to improve the manageability of large tables, reduce maintenance times, or enhance query performance. Partitioning can allow maintenance tasks like index rebuilds to be performed on smaller segments of data rather than the entire table, which might reduce the time required.

Performance Impact: Implementing table partitioning on a table this size (606 GB) can potentially improve performance, especially for queries that can take advantage of partition elimination. However, the impact on performance depends on the specific partitioning strategy used (e.g., range, list, or hash partitioning) and how well the queries are written to leverage partitions.

Possible Performance Implications and Disadvantages:

Query Plan Changes: Queries might require rewriting to ensure they benefit from partitioning, and some queries might perform worse if they cannot take advantage of the partitioning scheme.
Increased Complexity: Managing partitioned tables is more complex, and improper configuration can lead to inefficiencies, such as underutilized partitions or excessive partition maintenance overhead.
Index Rebuilds: While partitioning can help with index maintenance by allowing operations on individual partitions, it also means more careful planning and testing are needed to avoid locking or long-running operations on large partitions.
Compatibility and Issues: Partitioning can sometimes lead to unexpected issues with certain database features or third-party tools, and in worst-case scenarios, could potentially lead to disruptions in database architecture if not implemented correctly.
Application Team Responsibility: If the application team or manager is not willing to accept the risks or responsibility for the vendor's recommendation, it’s prudent to halt the implementation. The responsibility for the performance impact and potential issues should be clearly defined, with the application team being involved in testing and validation.

SLA Considerations: Any changes should be tested thoroughly in a lower environment. The vendor should provide detailed steps and scripts, which the DBA team will review before accepting the implementation. The SLA for the maintenance job should be updated based on the outcomes of these tests, and any changes raised by the application team should include thorough documentation.

In summary, table partitioning has potential benefits but also carries risks and requires careful consideration. Testing in a lower environment, detailed planning, and clear responsibility assignment are critical before moving forward. Let me know if you need any further discussion or clarification.
