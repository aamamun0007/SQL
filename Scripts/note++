The SolarWinds process was causing the application job to run slowly. The application team requested removing the server from SolarWinds monitoring, but it was necessary for analysis and performance tuning. As a workaround, we implemented a solution to kill the SolarWinds process if it ran for more than 5 minutes during the window when the application jobs were running.

To resolve low disk space and blocking issues, we identified several application jobs (which perform deletions, bulk inserts, and updates) as the cause. After investigating, I met with the vendor and recommended running the process in small batches to reduce blocking and low disk space issues, as there would be no long-running transactions. I also recommended increasing the disk space for the drive. The vendor is now working on it.
