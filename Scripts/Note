I am writing to address several inefficiencies encountered with our current database management processes, which are affecting our migration schedules and operational effectiveness. Detailed below are the issues along with proposed solutions for your consideration:

Extended Duration for Database Deletion: The process to remove databases from the DST environment is exceeding 20 minutes per database. This extended duration is significantly impacting our database migration schedules. Proposed Solution: Introduce an overwrite functionality that allows for direct restoration from the Source Server, bypassing the need for database deletion and re-importation.

Batch Deletion of Databases: Currently, the inability to drop multiple databases simultaneously is creating bottlenecks in our workflow. Proposed Solution: Implement a feature that enables the batch deletion of databases to streamline our operations.

Notification System for Database Operations: There is a lack of a systematic notification to the Sector DBA regarding database creation or deletion activities, especially when performed by Level 2 (L2) support teams. Proposed Solution: Establish a mandatory notification protocol to alert Sector DBAs of any database creation or deletion, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Inefficiency in Creating Empty Databases: The creation of an empty database is taking approximately 20 minutes, which is unsatisfactory. Proposed Solution: Review and optimize the database creation process to significantly reduce the time required.

Failover Process Duration During COB Test Failovers: The time taken for failover processes during Close of Business (COB) test failovers is longer than expected. Proposed Solution: Investigate the underlying causes of these delays and implement necessary adjustments to ensure a more efficient failover process.

Exclusion of CLM Patch Updates During Restoration: The inclusion of CLM patch updates during database restoration is adversely affecting our timelines. Proposed Solution: Modify the restoration procedure to exclude CLM patch updates, thereby optimizing the overall timeline.

We believe that addressing these issues with the suggested solutions will greatly enhance our database management capabilities, improve operational efficiency, and ensure we meet our project timelines. We look forward to your support in implementing these changes.

Thank you for considering our request. We are eager to discuss these proposals further and collaborate on the implementation process.
